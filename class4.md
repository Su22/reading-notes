#  Group Policy (GPO)
Group Policy is primarily a security tool, and can be used to apply security settings to users and computers. Group Policy allows administrators to define security policies for users and for computers

## Examples of GPOs
* A Group Policy Object could be used to determine the home page that a user sees when they launch their internet browser after logging onto the domain.
* Administrators can use GPOs to define which network connected printers appear on the list of available printers after a user in a specific Active Directory OU logs onto the domain.
* Admins can also use GPOs to tweak a number of security protocols and practices, such as restricting internet connection options, programs and even screen time.

## The Benefits of Group Policy for Data Security
Ease of administration -- system administrators can deploy software, patches and other updates via GPO. Better password policy enforcement -- GPOs determine password length, reuse rules and establish other requirements for passwords to keep a company's network safe.

## The Limitations of Group Policy

Flexibility is limited -- GPOs can only be applied to users or computers. So they're limited when it comes to applying settings based on context. Limited triggers -- GPOs can only be applied at computer startup, when a user logs on or at set intervals.
