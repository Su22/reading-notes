# RADIUS 

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that authorizes and authenticates users who access a remote network. A protocol is a collection of rules that control how something communicates or operates.

## How things work in RADIUS
The client sends the server a RADIUS authentication request. You don't decide what's in the request, the client does. The server doesn't decide what's in the request, the client does. The client is 100% responsible for everything in the request.

## What is the purpose of RADIUS server?
RADIUS servers receive user connection requests, authenticate the user, and then return the configuration information necessary for the client to deliver service to the user. A RADIUS server can act as a proxy client to other RADIUS servers or other kinds of authentication servers.

## Is RADIUS secure?
RADIUS supports overall network security by enabling advanced network access control. During authentication, it checks login credentials against the identity provider to verify that the requesting entity is authorized to access the network.
