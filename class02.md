#  Windows Domain
A Windows domain is essentially a network of controlled computers used in a business setting. At least one server, called a domain controller, is in charge of the other devices. This lets the network administrators (usually IT staff) control the computers on the domain through users, settings, and more.

## Workgroups vs. Domains
While a domain allows network admins to use servers to control all their assets that exist within the domain, a workgroup uses a LAN to communicate, and within a workgroup, no single machine or computer will have control over any other. Instead, they just share resources

## Which is better domain or workgroup?
A domain is mainly preferred for large public and business networks. A workgroup is mainly preferred for small local area networks like schools, colleges, buildings, etc.
