#  Network Segmentation

A network segment is a portion of a computer network. The nature and extent of a segment depends on the nature of the network and the device or devices used to interconnect end stations

## Why Is Network Segmentation Important?
Network segmentation can boost your overall security policy by limiting access privileges to those who need it, protecting the network from widespread cyberattacks and enabling better network performance by reducing the number of users in specific zones.

## Who Needs Network Segmentation?
Everyone running internal systems, whether physical or virtualized, to meet business needs network security. The more complicated the architecture, the more important the need for segmentation. The only users who wonâ€™t need network segmentation are businesses that rely 100% on software as a service (SaaS) solutions or alternatively a business that operates offline/without IT services.

## Benefits of Network Segmentation
* Damage control and limitation in case of an incident via the smaller attack surface
* Improved access control for external and internal network security
* Reducing the attack plane and scope of compliance requirements related auditing
* Improved performance with less congestion on network traffic
* Better analytics around network monitoring, network access and network devices
* Endpoint device protection, especially important as IoT devices become more common
