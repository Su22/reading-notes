# Active Directory
Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft's proprietary directory service. It runs on Windows Server and enables administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources. Active Directory stores data as objects. An object is a single element, such as a user, group, application or device such as a printer.

## Active Directory SERVICES
* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) 
* Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)
* Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) 

## AD Data Structures 
* A domain is a collection of objects (e.g. users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database. A domain is identified by a DNS name like company.com.
* A tree is a collection of one or more domains with a contiguous namespace (they have a common DNS root name like marketing.company.com, engineering.company.com, and sales.company.com).
* A forest is a collection of one or more trees that share a common schema, global catalog, and directory configuration—but aren’t part of a contiguous namespace. The forest typically serves as the security boundary for an enterprise network.

## AD Benefits
* Security – Active Directory helps businesses improve security by controlling access to network resources.
* Extensibility – companies can easily organize Active Directory data to align with their organizational structure and business needs.
* Simplicity – administrators can centrally manage user identities and access privileges across the enterprise, helping businesses simplify management and reduce operations expenses.
* Resiliency – Active Directory supports redundant components and data replication to enable high availability and business continuity.
