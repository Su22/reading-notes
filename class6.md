# OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s.

## What is the 7 layer OSI model?
* Physical
* Data Link
* Network
* Transport
* Session
* Presentation
* Application

## What Is Layer 2 in the OSI Model?
layer 2 is split into two parts: The media access control (MAC) sub layer and the data link sub layer. These sub layers each do their part to make up the computer’s physical address.

## What Is Layer 3 in the OSI Model?

The device that comes under this layer is the router. The functions include address handling,logical address and names to physical address translation ,routing and traffic management.

## What Is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.

## What Is Wireshark Used For?
Wireshark has many uses, including troubleshooting networks that have performance issues. Cybersecurity professionals often use Wireshark to trace connections, view the contents of suspect network transactions and identify bursts of network traffic. It’s a major part of any IT pro’s toolkit – and hopefully, the IT pro has the knowledge to use it.
