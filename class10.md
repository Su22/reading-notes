#  Site-to-Site VPN
A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) refers to a connection set up between multiple networks. This could be a corporate network where multiple offices work in conjunction with each other or a branch office network with a central office and multiple branch locations.

## VPN and Its Types
VPNs can be divided into three main categories â€“ remote access, intranet-based site-to-site, and extranet-based site-to-site. Individual users are most likely to encounter remote access VPNs, whereas big businesses often implement site-to-site VPNs for corporate purposes.
