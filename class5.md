# Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday

Patch Tuesday is an unofficial term used to refer to when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly releases software patches for their software products. It is widely referred to in this way by the industry. Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003.

## When Is Patch Tuesday?
Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month. More precisely, it occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America.
Microsoft doesn’t have a guaranteed time these patches and Microsoft’s information bulletins about them will be released. These updates generally arrive around 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, but they may be released later in the day.

## Why does Microsoft release patches on Patch Tuesday?
Microsoft releases most of its security patches on Patch Tuesdays. Fixes for more serious vulnerabilities, called out-of-band patches, are the exception. Microsoft chose Tuesday to release patches because that gives IT pros a day to prepare their systems.
